# Spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering
A guided project where I've built an ETL pipeline using the Spotify API on AWS. The pipeline will retrieve data from Spotify API, transform it to desirable formats, &amp; load it onto AWS data store.

Implemented complete Data Pipeline Data Engineering Project using Spotify:
- Integrating with Spotify API and extracting Data.
- Deploying code on AWS Lambda for Data Extraction.
- Adding trigger to run the extraction automatically.
- Writing transformation function.
- Building automated trigger on transformation function.
- Store files on S3 properly.
- Building Analytics Tables on data files using Glue and Athena.
